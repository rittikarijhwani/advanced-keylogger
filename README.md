# Advanced Keylogger in Python

## Project Overview  
This Advanced Keylogger is a comprehensive cybersecurity tool that captures and logs system activity, including keystrokes, clipboard data, system information, audio recordings, and screenshots. The project was built as part of a crash course by Grant Collins, helping me explore key cybersecurity and automation concepts.  

## Features  
- Keylogging and Clipboard Monitoring – Captures all keystrokes and clipboard contents.  
- System Information Retrieval – Logs details like OS, IP address, and hardware specs.  
- Audio and Screenshot Capture – Records microphone input and takes periodic screenshots.  
- Automated Email Notifications – Sends encrypted logs to a specified email address.  
- Encryption and Cleanup – Encrypts sensitive files and removes traces after execution.  

## Technologies Used  
- Python  
- Pynput (Keyboard listening)  
- Cryptography (Data encryption)  
- Sounddevice (Audio recording)  
- PIL (Screenshot capturing)  
- Smtplib (Email automation)
